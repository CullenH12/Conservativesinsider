        <div class="article-title">Biden to Replace Bald Eagle with Rainbow-Colored Pigeon as National Bird</div>

        <div class="article-content">
            In a shocking move that has enraged patriots across the nation, the Biden administration is allegedly pushing to replace the **majestic bald eagle** with a **"more inclusive" bird**—a **rainbow-colored pigeon**.

            According to anonymous sources within the White House, officials argue that the bald eagle is "too aggressive" and does not align with modern progressive values. The new proposed national bird, known as the **"Diversity Dove,"** is set to symbolize inclusivity, climate awareness, and a rejection of what officials call "**toxic patriotism.**"

            <div class="quote">"This is an attack on America’s identity," said a furious Senator Ted Cruz. "First they take our gas stoves, now they’re coming for our eagles!"</div>

            While the White House has yet to comment officially, leaked memos suggest that the administration is considering additional measures, such as replacing the national anthem with a **spoken-word poem** about equity and renaming the Washington Monument the **"People’s Obelisk."**

            Outraged conservatives have taken to social media, calling for immediate action. A viral petition titled **"SAVE THE BALD EAGLE"** has already gained over 2 million signatures in just a few hours.

            **Tucker Carlson** weighed in on the controversy, stating, "This is about control. They don’t just want to change the national bird—they want to change what it means to be American."

            Meanwhile, liberal activists are celebrating the decision, calling the bald eagle a "symbol of outdated nationalism." Some are even demanding that **Mount Rushmore be replaced with a giant mural of Greta Thunberg.**

            As tensions rise, GOP leaders have vowed to fight this decision in Congress. **Is this the final step in erasing traditional American values?** Stay tuned as this story develops.
