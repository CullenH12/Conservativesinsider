        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Washington, D.C. ‚Äì A controversial new initiative from the White House is sparking outrage across the nation, as reports suggest the **Biden administration is considering updating the national bird** to a more ‚Äúmodern and inclusive symbol.‚Äù</p>

            <p>Leaked internal discussions indicate that several advisors have **raised concerns about the bald eagle**, arguing that it is a ‚Äúdated and overly aggressive‚Äù representation of America. A proposal being floated reportedly suggests adopting a **more community-oriented** bird, with early candidates including a **dove, a pigeon, or a North American parrot.**</p>

            <div class="quote">"It‚Äôs about moving forward as a progressive society," said an anonymous White House source. "We need a national symbol that reflects inclusivity, environmental responsibility, and our commitment to global peace."</div>

            <p>Critics say the move is an attempt to **erase traditional American symbols**. Senator **Ted Cruz** condemned the discussion, calling it ‚Äúanother example of woke culture infiltrating American institutions.‚Äù</p>

            <p>"First it was our gas stoves, now they‚Äôre coming for our national bird," Cruz said in a fiery speech on the Senate floor. "Next thing you know, they'll be renaming the Lincoln Memorial."</p>

            <p>The controversy has led to an explosion of online petitions, with **over 2.3 million Americans signing a "SAVE THE BALD EAGLE" petition** within hours.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, progressive activists have praised the initiative, calling the bald eagle a ‚Äúsymbol of outdated nationalism.‚Äù Some have even **proposed that the new bird be colored with rainbow feathers** as a nod to diversity and inclusion.</p>

            <div class="quote">"The bald eagle has served its purpose," said a political strategist aligned with the movement. "It‚Äôs time for something fresh, something that reflects 21st-century values."</div>

            <p>While no official decision has been made, sources indicate that the White House may push for a **public poll** on the matter as soon as next month. Stay tuned as this story develops.</p>
